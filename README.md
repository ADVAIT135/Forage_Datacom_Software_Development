## Key Activities & Deliverables

### 1. Reviewing and Analyzing a Web Application

- Conducted a thorough review of a provided web application’s codebase.
- Assessed the design, user experience, and maintainability.
- Documented observations on architecture, code structure, and potential pain points.

### 2. Planning for Future Improvements

- Proposed enhancements to optimize performance, readability, and maintainability.
- Outlined short-term and long-term improvement plans in the documentation.
- Prioritized features and bug fixes based on impact and feasibility.

### 3. Bug Identification and Resolution

- Investigated reported issues and user feedback.
- Utilized debugging techniques to trace and isolate the root causes of application bugs.
- Implemented fixes and tested solutions to verify improvements.
- Documented the process, including before/after code snippets and testing outcomes.
