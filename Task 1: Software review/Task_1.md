# Bugs / Issues

## Snapping to cinema not working → Map interaction doesn’t correctly snap to the selected cinema.
## Geographic inconsistency → Map allows navigation worldwide, but cinema data is limited to Australia & New Zealand (creates confusion).
## UI/UX mismatch → Site design feels “too formal” and doesn’t align with cinema branding/theme.

# New Feature Requests

## Sorting & Filtering – Sort cinemas in the list. Advanced filters: candybar availability, ticket price, etc.
## Cinema Details – Show films available at each cinema. Add more pictures of cinemas. Display customer reviews/ratings.
## Map & Location – Auto-detect and show user’s location on page load.
## Booking Functionality – Enable direct film booking once a cinema is chosen.
